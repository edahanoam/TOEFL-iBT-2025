**TOEFL iBT 2025 Resources:**

- TestReady Daily Practice (FREE): ETS’s official preparation platform provides a new exercise every day (with scoring\!). It’s especially valuable for the Speaking and Writing sections:  
  [https://testready.ets.org/test-prep-library](https://testready.ets.org/test-prep-library)  
  (Don’t despair though, I got significantly lower scores on the website than on the actual test)

- Practice tests (FREE):  
  ETS website also offers a free full practice test with scores. I’d recommend taking it only after you’ve become familiar with the test format.

  Another free practice test (but with scores for Reading and Listening only) can be found here:

**Tips that were incredibly helpful:**

- Mindset: I tried to think of it not as learning English, but as learning how the test works. Focus on easily fixable issues, such as answer structure, and identify the question types you often get wrong so you can develop a strategy for them.

- Templates are necessary\! If you don’t know, these are structured ways to begin each Speaking and Writing task. I memorized one per task. Here are examples:

- How to Take notes (Listening):

- I struggled with the summary question -- this strategy was a game changer for me:

- Make sure to select the institutions you want to send your TOEFL scores to before test day (by 10:00 PM local time) -- you can choose up to four institutions for free, and you won’t be able to add them afterward without paying extra.



**Personal note:**
I took the TOEFL in October 2025, after studying for less than two weeks. I aimed for 100+ overall and 27+ in Speaking, and ended up scoring 116/120.
